  # The Storm Array

  The storm array siphons energy from the lighting storm above Trieste.

  It's a relatively simple machine, producing energy at a near constant rate in exchange for heat.
  The room the Storm Array is kept in MUST be kept cool, or it will begin degrading and eventually melt down and explode.
    > The device constantly vents heat into it's surroundings from the energy being transferred, requiring constant cooling.

  # Procedures

  The storm array's cooling machinery must be kept on at all times, providing a safe environment for it to channel the electricity.
  Do not touch the array without gloves, as it is highly charged and will electrocute anyone who comes in contact with it.

  The storm array is far too dangerous and complex to repair, so it is essential that it does not recieve any damage. 
    > In the event of a catastrophic meltdown, standard procedure is to utilize SMES batteries from the Artifact in Sweetwater for power.
