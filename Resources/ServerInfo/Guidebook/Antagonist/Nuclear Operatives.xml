  You've just been chosen to be a cascade operative for [color=#ADD8E6]Nanotrasen[/color]. You have one goal, deal with Trieste Port.

  ## Operatives
  Your team will be made up of several different roles, which are:
  - [bold]Operatives[/bold], standard soldiers who can take up the grunt work.
  - The [bold]Corpsman[/bold] who works with reagents to make medicines or chemical weapons.
  - The [bold]Commander[/bold] who draws up the plan and leads the team.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingOuterHardsuitSyndieCommander" Caption="commander's hardsuit"/>
  </Box>

  If you have been selected as the Corpsman or Commander but don't feel ready, one of your teammates can take over your responsibilities.

  ## The Disk

  Each operative starts with a [color=cyan]pinpointer[/color], which you should turn on and keep with you at all times. It will always point to the [color=cyan]Artifact Override Codes.[/color]
  The codes are stored on a disk which belongs to the [color=yellow]Overseer[/color], who will almost always have it on them. Follow the direction of the arrow on the pinpointer to the disk, and [italic]do whatever it takes to get it[/italic].

  ## Preparation
  Each member in your squad has been given an [color=cyan]uplink[/color] to purchase everything you will need for the mission, similar to [textlink="traitors." link="Traitors"]

  You can purchase the same kinds of gear traitors can, but you have higher quality gear available to you and more bluespace crystals to spend.

  You'll also have to choose if you want to [color=red]declare war[/color] or not. Doing so grants your team [bold]40 extra bluespace crystals each[/bold].
  However, the citizens will immediately know of your existence and will have plenty of time to prepare for your arrival.

  The [bold]Commander[/bold] is the only person who can declare war. Make your choice quick, [italic]this is a limited-time offer![/italic]

  ## Getting to the Platform
  You've got the plan, you've got the gear. Now, execute.

  Your landing area will be the generally uninhabited Waste Zone. Prepare to move fast post-splashdown.

  When everyone is ready, FTL to the planet and touch down on the surface. Your pinpointers and delaminator.


  ## The Artifact & Arming Procedure
