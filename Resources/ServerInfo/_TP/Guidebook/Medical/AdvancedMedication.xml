  [color=red]USE CAUTION[/color] when using the aforementioned proteins. Should they mix together, the result will cause cellular damage to the patient, resulting in the need for Stabilization Proteins.

  To avoid this, make sure the patient is done metabolizing one brute medication before giving them another. Keep an eye on the rate their health is changing.

  # Temperature
  SolGov's scientists have also specialized two types of chemicals that will be used to modify the body temperature of a patient! Keep a note on what temperatures each protein requires for the damage subtype your patient has.
