  So sombody is really hurt? Lets do something about that!

  # What is Algae?

  Algae is a specialised medicine using modified strains of the algae naturally found on Trieste. Some important facts to know are:

  1. They last a long time

  2. In the right circumstances, they can heal extremely quickly

  3. How effective they are is based upon body temp

  ## How to grow algae

  Benefical algal strains are primarily derived from activated algae.

  To "Activate" algae, you will need some carbon, oxygen, feedstock, sea water (to get the algae in the first place), and a important ingredient called dormant organics.

  To get dormant organics, heat a medicine up untill it denatures. I recommend inaprovaline

  This will net you some denatured protiens, which you can run through a centrifuge for some basic elements and some dormant organics.

  ## Now what?

  Currently, there are 2 main ways to specialise the proteins

  You can make either

  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="ReinforcementAlgae"/>

  or

  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="RegenerationAlgae"/>

  Reinforcement Algae deals with brute damage, while Regeneration deals with burn

  Both of them heal all of said damage type, but with a very large booste depending on body temp

  You can check the chemical guidebook to see exactly what the temps are

  To get the correct temperatures, use

  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="Calordine"/>
  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="Cryodine"/>

  (There is also a non-protein med that functions like this, made by combining lepo and lepa)

  ## Anything else?

  Algae can also be used to hyper-oxygenate saline, allowing it to deal with both bloodloss and asphyxiation

  Also, don't mix the two proteins, or you will have to pull out the third protein specialization

  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="StabilizationAlgae"/>
