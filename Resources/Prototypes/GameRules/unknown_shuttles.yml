# TODO for pirates: Make a small pirate vessel called the Corsair, which has (at least), a cargo sell console connected to a pallate so that they can get money from their findings.
# They should also have atmospheric thrusters. Preferably, merge jumping before this is made so that they can jump on and off of their vessel.

# Specs: 3 crew (one captain), one blunderbus and ammo, two rifles and ammo, a handcranked rifle, cutlasses, a copy of the pirate code
