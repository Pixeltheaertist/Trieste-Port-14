## Trieste Port

Trieste Port is a fork of Space Station 14, taking place on a ex-nanotrasen oil rig repurposed into a corporate-free safe haven on an outer-rim frontier ocean planet. It focuses on the daily lives of the citizens of Trieste, both above and beneath the waves. Citizens face dangers such as Nanotrasen infiltrators, pirates, horrific deep-sea fauna, and the crushing depths of the abyss. Enjoy the chaos and adventure as you carve your story across the rusted hull of the platform.

TRIESTE PORT is also open-source, so anyone is free to contribute to the project! If you have questions or need help, don't hesitate to ask in the discord!

I also absolutely don't mind if other forks wish to use our code for their own projects. After all, SS14 is all about collaboration! As long as it's not code ported over from another fork, of course. See attributions.

## Building

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `RUN_THIS.py` to init submodules and download the engine.
